    <h3>Life & History</h3>
    <p>Revan was born on an unknown outer rim planet, and raised in the Jedi enclave. 
        There, he was the favorite of many of his teachers and made quick friends with <a href="relations.html#Alek">Alek</a>
        At the same time, the Mandalorians were attacking many planets in their quest for conquest. 
        Revan was extremely critical of the Jedi's inaction regarding the mandalorians, and organized for many Jedi to break away from Jedi Council.
        Adopting the name of Revan and gaining the nickname of 'the Revanchist,' Revan led the war against the Mandalorians, using brutality to force the Mandalorians into an unconditional surrender. 
        After defeating Mandalore the Ultimate, Revan learned of an unknown threat in the unknown regions of Space. 
        There, he disappeared for five years, and while the exact details of what happened to him during this time known, several different characters present their hypothesis. 
        His former Jedi Master, Kreia, believed that he was able to use his intellect to release that the best course of action of defeating the Sith Empire would be to militarize the Jedi and the republic against the Sith. 
        Others were under the impression that Revan was under the control of the Sith Empire, who had the ability to exert his will onto others via the Dark Side of the Force. 
        Regardless, Revan returned as a sith lord with his own apprentice, Darth Malak, to fight the Republic with an impossibly large fleet. 
        Known among the Republic as a savior, many people and soldiers defected to aid Revan.
