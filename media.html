<!--Doc talks about when we see revan, specifically in his game, 
flashbacks in sequal game, 
snippits in comic, 
short arc in swtor, 
book, 
I think animated videos (link~)
and maybe mention how he was cut out of being in clone wars 2008 but thats good because his whole thing wasnt that he was evil-->
