        <h3>Knights of the Old Republic</h3>
        <p>Most well known for the popular game Knights of The Old Republic (2003), Revan originally seems to appear as a dead antagonist, with no direct role in the story.
            However, as the story continues, we begin to learn that not everything as it seems. 
            During a fight between the player and Darth Malak (Revan's former apprentice), it is revealed that Revan was still alive, only without his memories.
            <br>Unlike KOTOR 1, KOTOR 2 features no direct appearance of Revan. 
            However, the game is from the perspective of the Jedi Exile, a former follower of Revan, resulting in the game showing several flashbacks of them. 
            Along with that, the game features several different former crewmates of Revan from KOTOR, resulting in the game having numerous references towards him.

    <section id="Book">
        <h3>Star Wars: The Old Republic: Revan by Drew Karpyshyn</h3>
        <p>Starting between KOTOR 1 and 2, the novel details how Revan fell into the hands of the Sith Empire in the unknown regions, all while revealing how Revan became a sith in the first place.
            The novel covers an expansive period of time, ending after KOTOR 2, as to provide the Jedi Exile with an ending to their story.
            While the novel opted not to give Revan an identity, the novel did provide Revan with a cannon gender (male) and gave him a partner (Bastila).

            Referrenced frequently in mission titles, Revan is also given his own sith cult, which the sith empire is bent on destroying. 
            He also appears for a few scenes during the rise of the second Sith Empire.</p>
