    <p>Throughout Star Wars Legends, Revan leaves a lasting legacy. 
        His descendants remained in the jedi order for many generations, and helped defeat the Sith Empire.
        Members of the Sith Empire were inspired by his strength, resulting in a cult being based around him in <a href="media.html#SWTOR">SWTOR</a>.
        And, undoubtably, he left a lasting impact on the Republic for protecting it against the Mandalorians</p>
