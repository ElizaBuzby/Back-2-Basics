        <p>One of Revan's love interests while playing as a man in KOTOR, Bastila is a confident and prodigious young jedi knight.
            The two characters share a strong force bond with eachother as a result of Bastila saving Revan's life, resulting in them being able to share dreams and visions among eachother. 
            Later, the Revan novel and SWTOR later confirmed that Bastila and Revan was the cannonical pairing, and that the two of them started a family together. </p>
